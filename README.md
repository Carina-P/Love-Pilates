## UX
### Project Goals 
A website to attract clients to the online classes at a Pilates studio. 
During pandemic the studio cannot have classes in the studio so they started to offer online classes.
The goal is to keep regular customers active and lojal to the studio but also to find new clients.
New client will hopefully become regular clients and in the future also use the studio. And perhaps online classes will be something that continues even after the pandemic.
### Target Audience goals:  
The site users are the studios regular clients but also potential clients. The clients wants to know which classes are offered, when they are offered, what is needed to join an online class. 
A potential client wants to know about pilates, how professional the studio is and if it is a studio that fits this client.

### Site owner's goal: 
The studio is interested in attracting and retaining members during unusual times.

### Potential features to include: 
- photos and citates from people who experience how good pilates whit emphasis on workout at home
- provide detail on the classes, what you need to take part, their schedule and link to actual online class
- provide information on the instructur of the centre to show the competence and seriousness.
- Provide information about Pilates and what it is good for.
- Provide information on contact details and external resources.
- Sign up to be a member and give the studio contact information as mail. And also chose if you want weekly mail with information about pilates, tips and on upcoming events
- Showcase photo of people exercising in the studio. This is to remind people that there also is a studio to go to if they want to.

### User Stories:
- As a potential client I want to get a "feeling for the studio", what it offers, the atmosphere and how professionel they are. I want to see pictures and photos and I want to know more about the instructors.
- As a regular client I want to see at what time different classes are.
- As a potential and regular client I want to know what the different class do and find the right class for me.
- As a regular and potential client I want to find contact information to the studio so I can ask my questions.
- As a regular and potential client I want to sign up for membership or get more information

### How the features is prioritized: 
1. Photos and citates - important for attracting potential clients
1. Sign up for membership including information-letter - important way to keep in touch with clients especially during pandemic, so they remember the studio when times are normal again.
2. Link to the digital class - important for regular clients and probably what they use the site to most of the time 
3. The classes schedule - important for regular clients and probably what they use the site to most of the time 
4. What classes are offered and what do you need to take part - important for potential clients and for regular clients who for example wants to test another type of class
5. What is Pilates - information for potential clients
5. Information about the instructors - to show that this is a professional studio
6. Contact information - to ask questions 
7. Information about the studio - shows it is a professional studio and it is also to remind about and find the studio when everything is back to normal

### How the features were grouped
- Headder: Title and navigation
- Home: Photos and citates and short what Pilates is. Problably a button for signing up and another to link for classes
- Sign Up: Sign up for membership
- Classes: Which classes are offered, when they are offered, link to digital class and information about what you need to take part (e.g space, mat, rubber band)
- About: About the studio and about the instructors
- Footer: contact information and external links

## User requirements and Expectations
### Requirements
* Navigate the website using navbar
* Be provided with information on the studio
* Content with visual appealing manor
* Having a contact form

### Expectations
* Content is visually satisfying and informative
* Navigation take user to specific Pages
* Visual appealing data from external sources
## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq Wireframes to build rudimentary wireframes for a basic understanding.
I have made wireframes for three pages and for each page I have frames for each of Desktop/Tablet/Mobile.
The wireframes a saved in this workspace under assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf. 

## Design Choices
The theme of this sight is Pilates, working out in a smart way, strengthening the body never hurting it. 
The feeling is sensible, calm but also a little tough. Calm pastelle colours with some strong colours.
### Fonts
I have choosen **Open Sans** that I think is a clear, friendly, easy to read font.
### Icons
**Icons** used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in **moderation** and are self explanatory.
### Colours
### Styling
### Images
### Backgrounds
## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Bugs
## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
