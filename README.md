## UX
### Project Goals 
A website to attract clients to the online classes at a Pilates studio. 
During pandemic the studio cannot have classes in the studio so they started to offer online classes.
The goal is to keep regular customers active and lojal to the studio but also to find new clients.
New client will hopefully become regular clients and in the future also use the studio. And perhaps online classes will be something that continues even after the pandemic.
### Target Audience goals:  
The site users are the studios regular clients but also potential clients. The clients wants to know which classes are offered, when they are offered and a link to join. 
A potential client wants to know about pilates, how professional the studio is and if it is a studio that fits this client.

### Site owner's goal: 
The studio is interested in attracting and retaining members during unusual times.

### Potential features to include: 
- **Quotes and photos** from people who experience how good pilates whit emphasis on workout at home
- Provide **detail on the classes**, what you need to take part, their schedule and link to actual online class
- Provide **information on the instructur** of the centre to show the competence and seriousness.
- Provide **information about Pilates** and what it is good for.
- Provide information on **contact details and external resources**.
- **Sign up to come be a member** and give the studio contact information as mail address.
- **Showcase photo** of people exercising in the studio. This is to remind people that there also is a studio to go to if they want to.

### User Stories:
Regular Clients:
- As a user I want to get a **"feeling for the studio"**, what it offers, the atmosphere and how professionel they are. 
- As a user I want to see **pictures and photos**
- As a user I want to know more about the **instructors**.
- As a user I want to see at **what time different classes** are.
- As a user I want to know **what the different class do** and find the right class for me.
- As a user I want to find **contact information** to the studio so I can ask my questions.
- As a user I want to **sign up for membership** 
- As a user I want a **link to join a online class**

### How the features are prioritized:  
1. **Sign up for membership** - important way to keep in touch with clients especially during pandemic, so they remember the studio when times are normal again.
2. **Link to the digital class** - important for regular clients and probably what they use the site to most of the time 
3. **The classes schedule** - important for regular clients and probably what they use the site to most of the time 
4. **Quotes and Photos** - important for attracting potential clients
5. **What classes** are offered and what do you need to take part - important for potential clients and for regular clients who for example wants to test another type of class
6. **What is Pilates** - information for potential clients
7. **Information about the instructors** - to show that this is a professional studio
8. **Contact information** - to ask questions 
9. **Information about the studio** - shows it is a professional studio and it is also to remind about and find the studio when everything is back to normal

### How the features were grouped
- **Header**: Title and navigation
- **Home**: Photos and citates and short what Pilates is. Problably a button for signing up and another to link for classes
- **Sign Up**: Sign up for membership
- **Classes**: Which classes are offered, when they are offered, link to digital class and information about what you need to take part (e.g space, mat, rubber band)
- **About**: About the studio and about the instructors
- **Footer**: contact information and external links

## User requirements and Expectations
### Requirements
* Navigate the website using **navbar**
* **Easily sign up for membership** in a contact form: giving name, a correct mailadress and level of experience
* Being able to **join a online** class with a click
* See **quotes, with photos,** about what other think about the studio, instructors and Pilates.
* Being **provided with information**:
    * about **Pilates** 
    * on the **studio**
    * the **instructors**
    * about **classes**
    * what **time** different online classes take place


### Expectations
* Content is **visually satisfying and informative**
* **Easily understandable navigation** take user to correct place
* **Links and buttons** work as espected
* **Responsive design** fitting on mobile, tablet and desktop
* **Form validation** works correctly

## Wireframes
I [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to build rudimentary wireframes for a basic understanding.
I have made wireframes for three pages and for each page I have frames for each of Desktop/Tablet/Mobile.
[Wireframes](https://github.com/Carina-P/LovePilates/blob/master/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

I checked wireframes with users and especially younger preferred all information in one page since it is a moderate amount of features: they use mobile device and do not want to click a lot.
One user suggested to use a carousel for quotes - takes less space. I tried that and thougt it was appealing.

This change also made me change the order of features (sections) to satisfy what the user told me.

## Design Choices
I looked around different pilates sites to find inspiration and desided that I wanted a hero-image to be a drawn picture - for me it felt more modern. I found a picture that I thought was inspiring 
(found above). And the picture inspired to the colors I have choosen to use. 
I think grey is a cool and neutral color. I want to use that and add some colors to make the site more positive and draw attention to it.

Comment: After testing and talking to users I decided to use more white than grey.

### Fonts
I have choosen **Open Sans** that I think is a modern, friendly, easy to read font.

### Icons
**Icons** used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in **moderation** and are self explanatory.

### Colours
* For text: Charchool #373f51
* Some headers and titels: Raisin black #262730
* For body background: White #ffffff
* For header and footer background: Cultured #eff1f0
* For buttons and backgrounds that I want to stand out: Rose Madder #df2935. Font on this background is White #ffffff for better contrast.
* For some padding and buttons-background to accenture: Sunray #e7b76f

<img src="/wireframes/colors-pilates.png" width="75%">

After testing I decided that I wanted more color and did not use gray backgrounds as much as I planned. For good contrast I choosed to use the darker color for all text on lighter background. 
I still use above colors but it looks like this instead:
* Fonts for good contrast:
    * Lighter backgrounds: Raisin black #262730
    * Darker backgrounds: White: #ffffff
* Backgrounds: Sunray #e7b76f, Cultured #eff1f0 and  Charchool #373f51
* All buttons: Rose Madder #DF2935 and white #ffffff

## Technologies Used
### Languages
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) 
    * The perfect language to build a static site.
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) 
    * For styling the site
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
    * Used for making the navbar collaps when clicking - its hard to see otherwise, especially on small viewports

### Tools and libraries
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * For version control and storing the code
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    * A helpful HTML, CSS (and JS) library
* [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
    * From this library I picked the icons
* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * For inspiration and fonts
* [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/)
    * For designing the wireframes
* [Coolors](https://balsamiq.com/)
    * To generate color-schemes

## Testing

All testing have been conducted **manually**.
Testing was performed **regularly** in a iterative manner during the development of the site and then **thorough** after all features was in place. 
Testing often after a small part of development means that it is easier to find and fix bugs and it is also a way to use experience in coming development.

Description of the iterative manner of developing and testing:
1. The basic structure in html was put in place
    After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
2. First round of implementing with Bootstrap
     After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
3. Second round of implementing with Bootstrap to improve
    After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
4. At last the styling is css was put in place
    After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
5. After that improving details started
    After each detail build - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
6. And so on...

When all features was implemented the following tests was performed:
- Validated by [W3S Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Validated by [W3s CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- According to the **scenarios** as described below
- The deployed version was tested

## Validation with W3S
### Markup Validation
The following messages was received:
1. Warning: The document is not mappable to XML 1.0 due to two consecutive hyphens in a comment.
    - Solved by removing extra hyphens in comments
2. Error: End tag br
    - corrected </br> to <br>
3. Error: Attribute arial-label not allowed on element a at this point.
    - corrected my spelling to aria-label
4. Error: End tag div seen, but there were open elements.
    -  corrected when I solved the blockquote-bug below
5. Error: Unclosed element blockquote.
    - corrected by putting the missing </blockquote> in place
6. Error: The value of the for attribute of the label element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control.
    - corrected the attribute
7. Warning: The date input type is not supported in all browsers. Please be sure to test, and consider using a polyfill.
    - **I decided not change anything.** So this is perhaps not supported on all browsers. But this is also not a crucial feature. The join-link 
    is just "fake".

I corrected the code for no 1 to 6 above but not 7. I took away the code causing warning no 7, did the validation again and got this message:
"Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show." 

Comment: It was stupid errors, that I wish I had not done, but I am happy that they where found.

### CSS Validation
Got a "Congratulations! No errors were found" but with a warning: "Imported styles are not reviewed for direct input or file upload". And this is reffering to the import of fonts and 
I decided that I could trust Google font that I imported from.

## Scenarios

Checking these scenarios for mobile, tablet and desktop respectively

1. Navigating from menu in header:

        - Quotes-selection
2. Navigate with arrows in bottom of every "viewport-page":

    2. For each section ("viewport-page") check that when clicking on arrow in bottom: Next section is showing. 
3. Links in Callout
    1. At beginning of page callout-section over painted picture

    3. Check that clicking on the arrow to the right makes the carousel show next content
    4. Check that clicking on the arrow to the left makes the carousel show previous content

5. Read more about Pilates
    1. Go to section "What is Pilates?"
    2. Check that the button Read More goes to external wikipedia-page about Pilates. 
    3. Check that the page is opened in a new tab.

6. Contact form:
    1. Go to the Sign Up-section

8. Links in footer  
    1. Go to footer
    2. Check that external links works and appears in new tab

## Some of the bugs
1. "Hero-image" was not looking good in different viewport-sizes. I tested in many ways before I decided a solution: 
    - Bacground-size contain for lager viewports (over 992px) and cover for the rest. In this way the whole girl is always shown.
2. A stupid bug was that the same text was shown in all Modals but for different studio-classes:
    - The problem was that I had used the same id (and datatarget) for all. Also a stupid bug but easy to fix.
3. Radio button-list in Sign up-form did not look good:
    - After a while I realized that I had to put input before label if I wanted text after (instead of before) the little circle.
4. Carousel: 
    - I copied code from bootstrap and it took me a while to figure out how to make it look good with "two parts": photo and text. 
    - I also thought the indicators was interfering with the text. The only, and not a very good, solution that I found was to include a hidden text.
5. The fixed navbar hides content: e.g. clicking on Sign Up leads to Sign Up section but the headline of Sign up is hidden behind the navbar (header):
    - I gave each section a larger top-margin. 
    - And I also make navbar collaps, when clicking, in smaller viewports. 
6. I got a comment from a tester that it is not obvious that the page has more information whe looking at the first part of the page.
    - A put an icon-link, in the form of an arrow, in the bottom of each "viewport-page", to indicate that more information further down. The link also leads to next "viewport-page"
7. When doing scenario number 2 I found out that several "arrow"-links in bottom of viewport-pages lead to wrong section. This was due to changing the order
of some sections. 
    - fixed
8. Doing test in scenario number 4. Found out that the quotes did not fit in the iphone5 viewport. 
    - Added @media that checked for viewports that was smaller in height than 700 px and in this case let the section have the length of minimum 700 px.
9. After comments from user I removed the drop-down-list in menu
10. Commit:
    - It took me a while to understand what it meant to commit often. But I think I got better and better.
