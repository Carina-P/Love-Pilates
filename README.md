## UX
### Project Goals 
A website to attract clients to the online classes at a Pilates studio. 
During pandemic the studio cannot have classes in the studio so they started to offer online classes.
The goal is to keep regular customers active and lojal to the studio but also to find new clients.
New client will hopefully become regular clients and in the future also use the studio. And perhaps online classes will be something that continues even after the pandemic.
### Target Audience goals:  
The site users are the studios regular clients but also potential clients. The clients wants to know which classes are offered, when they are offered and a link to join. 
A potential client wants to know about pilates, how professional the studio is and if it is a studio that fits this client.

### Site owner's goal: 
The studio is interested in attracting and retaining members during unusual times.

### Potential features to include: 
- **Quotes and photos** from people who experience how good pilates whit emphasis on workout at home
- Provide **detail on the classes**, what you need to take part, their schedule and link to actual online class
- Provide **information on the instructur** of the centre to show the competence and seriousness.
- Provide **information about Pilates** and what it is good for.
- Provide information on **contact details and external resources**.
- **Sign up to come be a member** and give the studio contact information as mail address.
- **Showcase photo** of people exercising in the studio. This is to remind people that there also is a studio to go to if they want to.

### User Stories:
Regular Clients:
- As a user I want to get a **"feeling for the studio"**, what it offers, the atmosphere and how professionel they are. 
- As a user I want to see **pictures and photos**
- As a user I want to know more about the **instructors**.
- As a user I want to see at **what time different classes** are.
- As a user I want to know **what the different class do** and find the right class for me.
- As a user I want to find **contact information** to the studio so I can ask my questions.
- As a user I want to **sign up for membership** 
- As a user I want a **link to join a online class** I have choosen.

### How the features is prioritized: 
1. **Quotes and Photos** - important for attracting potential clients
1. **Sign up for membership** - important way to keep in touch with clients especially during pandemic, so they remember the studio when times are normal again.
2. **Link to the digital class** - important for regular clients and probably what they use the site to most of the time 
3. **The classes schedule** - important for regular clients and probably what they use the site to most of the time 
4. **What classes** are offered and what do you need to take part - important for potential clients and for regular clients who for example wants to test another type of class
5. **What is Pilates** - information for potential clients
5. **Information about the instructors** - to show that this is a professional studio
6. **Contact information** - to ask questions 
7. **Information about the studio** - shows it is a professional studio and it is also to remind about and find the studio when everything is back to normal

### How the features were grouped
- **Header**: Title and navigation
- **Home**: Photos and citates and short what Pilates is. Problably a button for signing up and another to link for classes
- **Sign Up**: Sign up for membership
- **Classes**: Which classes are offered, when they are offered, link to digital class and information about what you need to take part (e.g space, mat, rubber band)
- **About**: About the studio and about the instructors

### Expectations

* **Responsive design** fitting on mobile, tablet and desktop
* **Form validation** works correctly

## Wireframes
I [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to build rudimentary wireframes for a basic understanding.
I have made wireframes for three pages and for each page I have frames for each of Desktop/Tablet/Mobile.
[Wireframes](https://github.com/Carina-P/LovePilates/blob/master/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

I checked wireframes with users and especially younger preferred all information in one page since it is a moderate amount of features: they use mobile device and do not want to click a lot.
One user suggested to use a carousel for quotes - takes less space. I tried that and thougt it was appealing.

## Design Choices
The theme of this sight is Pilates, working out in a smart way, strengthening the body never hurting it. 
The feeling is sensible, calm but also stubborn and strong.
I looked around different pilates sites to find inspiration and desided that I wanted a hero-image to be a drawn picture - for me it felt more modern. I found a picture that I thought was inspiring, 
found above. And the picture inspired to the colors I have choosen to use. 
I think grey is a cool and neutral color. I want to use that and add some colors to make the site more positive and draw attention to it.

### Fonts
I have choosen **Open Sans** that I think is a modern, friendly, easy to read font.

### Icons
**Icons** used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in **moderation** and are self explanatory.

### Colours
* For text: Charchool #373f51
* Some headers and titels: Raisin black #262730
* For body background: White #ffffff
* For header and footer background: Cultured #eff1f0
* For buttons and backgrounds that I want to stand out: Rose Madder #df2935. Font on this background is White #ffffff for better contrast.
* For some padding and buttons-background to accenture: Sunray #e7b76f

<img src="/wireframes/colors-pilates.png" width="75%">

After testing I decided that I wanted more color and did not use gray backgrounds as much as I planned. For good contrast I choosed to use the darker color for all text on lighter background. 
I still use above colors but it looks like this instead:
* Fonts for good contrast:
    * Lighter backgrounds: Raisin black #262730
    * Darker backgrounds: White: #ffffff
* Backgrounds: Sunray #e7b76f, Cultured #eff1f0 and  Charchool #373f51
* All buttons: Rose Madder #DF2935 and white #ffffff

## Testing

All testing have been conducted **manually**.
Testing was performed **regularly** in a circular manner during the development of the site and then **thorough** after all features was in place. 
Testing often after a small part of development means that it is easier to find and fix bugs and it is also a way to use the experience found in coming development.

Description of the circular manner of developing and testing:
1. The basic structure in html was put in place
    After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
2. First round of implementing with Bootstrap
     After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
3. Second round of implementing with Bootstrap to improve
    After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
4. At last the styling is css was put in place
    After each section completed - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
5. After that improving details started
    After each detail build - test was performed for mobile, tablet and desktop each
6. And so on...

When all features was implemented the following tests was performed:
- According to the **scenarios** as described below
- Validated by [W3S Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Validated by [W3s CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Validation with W3S
### Markup Validation
The following messages was received:
- Warning: The document is not mappable to XML 1.0 due to two consecutive hyphens in a comment.
    - Solved by removing extra hyphens in comments
- Error: End tag br
    - corrected </br> to <br>
- Error: Attribute arial-label not allowed on element a at this point.
    - corrected my spelling to aria-label
- Error: End tag div seen, but there were open elements.
    -  corrected when I solved the blockquote-bug below
- Error: Unclosed element blockquote.
    - corrected by putting the missing </blockquote> in place
- Error: The value of the for attribute of the label element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control.
    - corrected the attribute

Did the validation after correction the above and got: "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

Comment: It was stupid errors, that I wish I had not done, but I am happy that they where found.

### CSS Validation
Got a "Congratulations! No errors were found" but with a warning: "Imported styles are not reviewed for direct input or file upload". And this is reffering to the import of fonts and 
I decided that I could trust Google font that I imported from.

## Scenarios

Checking these scenarios for mobile, tablet and desktop respectively

1. Navigating from menu in header:
    1. Check that clicking on logo leads to homepage
    2. Check that clicking on Home goes to homepage
    3. Check that clicking on Sign Up leads to Sign up-form
    4. Check that clicking on Classes leads to the section about classes
    5. Check that the choices in About us drop down leads to page informing that it is not implemented

2. Links in Callout
    1. At beginning of page callout-section over painted picture
    1. Check that Sign Up-button leads to Sign Up-section
    2. Check that Join class-button show a popover when clicked. And that popover disappears when clicking anywhere.

3. Carousel
    1. Go to Quotes-part 
    2. Check that the carousel is moving correctly
    3. Check that clicking on the arrow to the right makes the carousel show next content
    4. Check that clicking on the arrow to the left makes the carousel show previous content

4. Read more about Pilates
    1. Go to section "What is Pilates?"
    2. Check that the button Read More goes to external wikipedia-page about Pilates. 
    3. Check that the page is opened in a new tab.

5. Contact form:
    1. Go to the Sign Up-section
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

6. Classes:
    1. Got to the section with classes
    2. Try to click all Read Me-buttons and check that modal with correct information appears
    3. Try to click all Join class-buttons and check that you get the message that it is not implemented.

7. Links in footer  
    1. Go to footer
    2. Check that external links works and appears in new tab

## Bugs
1. "Hero-image" was not looking good in different viewports. I tested in many ways before I decided a solution: 
    - Bacground-size contain for lager viewports (over 992px) and cover for the rest. In this way the whole girl is always shown.
2. A stupid bug was that the same text was shown in all Modals but for different classes:
    - The problem was that I had used the same id (and datatarget) for all. Also a stupid bug but easy to fix.
3. Radio button-list in Sign up-form did not look good:
    - After a while I realized that I had to put <input> befor <label> if I wanted text after (instead of before) the litle circle.
4. Carousel: 
    - Took me a while to figure out how to make it look good with "two parts" in the content. The code I copied from Bootstrap was intended
    one type of content only.
5. Header hides the content under e.g. clicking on Sign Up leads to Sign Up section but the headline of Sign up is hidden behind the navbar (header):
    - I realize that I can give each container a larger top-margin. Put since the header is 92px I thought it would take to much space and a made 
    the navbar a little optique insteda. I am not perfectly happy about that.
6. Wanted something to show that the Join Class-buttons still is not implemented and I was curious about popover. The text in button suddenly did not show:
Found out that text was inherited and this parents text was in white and button-background was white. This took me a while to solve especially since I did 
not understand tips in Bootstrap that referred to JavaScript that I do not know yet. In the end I solved it by putting the button in a container. And the container I gave the color Raisin Black.
